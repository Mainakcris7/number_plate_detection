# Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) ðŸš—

Introducing my latest project, an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system powered by `YOLOv8` and `EasyOCR`, boasting an outstanding Mean Average Precision (mAP) of over `96%`. Leveraging the capabilities of YOLOv8 for robust object detection and EasyOCR for accurate text recognition, this project represents a significant achievement in my exploration of computer vision and machine learning. With a focus on efficiently detecting and extracting license plate information from images, this endeavor showcases my dedication to pushing the boundaries of technology while delivering practical solutions. As a culmination of extensive research and experimentation, this ANPR system underscores my commitment to excellence in developing cutting-edge data science solutions with real-world applications.
    
You can find some test [Images](/Images) and [Videos](/Videos) in the repository itself.

All the results will be stored in [Detections](./Detections) automatically.

To execute the streamlit application -
```
python -m streamlit run number_plate_detect.py
```
